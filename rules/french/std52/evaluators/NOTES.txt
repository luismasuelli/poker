The showdown algorithms here are Versiones Sumamente Chotas of what one should use for simulations.
This, because these algorithms will not be used for simulations but just for table evaluation.

In a distant future, even far beyond the moment the mankind defeats AIDS, Cancer and Coronavirus,
I may implement better versions of these algorithms. But not now. Fuck everything.
